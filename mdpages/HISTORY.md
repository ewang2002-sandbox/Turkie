# History of Turkie
For those interested, here is the history. To preface, I am the owner of a small Discord server with just my high school friends. We have approximately 75 verified high school students in the server, with 3 bots.

In early March, my friend, Dakota (@icicl), made a bot known as [Blub Bot](https://github.com/icicl/blub-bot) that would be used in our small server; however, shortly after the code was published to Github, Blub Bot nuked our server. We immediately found out that the token was published on the Github repository; you can guess what happened to Blub Bot after that. 

On May 21, 2018, I decided that I wanted to make a Discord bot. I decided to undertake the journey of creating TurkieBot. The name, "Turkie," came from one of my friends, who would purposely spell "turkey" as "turkie." The name stuck, so I kept it. The bot's profile picture came from another friend, who happens to be a great artist as well!

I was able to make the bot do some interesting things, ranging from ghost-pinging to the classic ping command. Through the development of TurkieBot, I was able to become more proficient in JavaScript. 

The bot underwent many transitional states. While I won't go into detail, I will say this: The first version of the bot was simply an `index.js` file consisting of 8000 lines of if/else statements. The bot could only work in one server -- my server. Needless to say, I had a fun time debugging. 

One major issue my bot has was the number of features I was adding to it. The bot was becoming more and more bloated and was thus becoming more slower. While I didn't do anything to fix it, I was very much aware and was considering a complete rewrite of the bot.

Anyways, in the 2018-2019 school year, I took an AP Computer Science A class. While learning Java, I also decided to pick up TypeScript and found that TypeScript was the better version of JavaScript. 

Naturally, being the procrastinator I was, I didn't actually start working on the bot. In fact, I didn't even work on TurkieBot (it's been a month since I last updated the old bot). However, when I saw Discord hosting their very first hack week, I decided that I would participate. How? By making Turkie, the enhanced version of TurkieBot. TurkieBot Reborn.
